Use Cloud Shell

My Quick Tips --> https://dev.to/lynnlangit/aws-cloud-shell-quick-tips-1n5o

 setup autocomplete, must run before EACH command!
 `aws --cli-auto-prompt`

 1. buckets
 `aws s3...` vs
 `aws s3api...` vs
 `aws s3control...`

 aws s3api create-bucket --bucket new-langit --region us-east-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-east-1

 2. IAM

 use the console to learn what you want to do 
 script after
 `aws iam create-user <name> ....`

 MFA on root user
 create two other users 
 - admin - non-root (set MFA)
 - non-admin - no console access (show CloudShell)

 3. Billing alert

 use console and search - in CloudWatch NOT Billing!
 script after
 `aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state --alarm-name billing...`

 log in to CloudShell (restrict 'click on the console')
 login to local aws cli
